I want to briefly write down few conclusions and thoughts after attending last [DevFestDC](http://www.devfestdc.org/) organized by the guys from [Google Dev Group DC](https://twitter.com/gdevdc) and hosted at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) before it gets too late.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the organizers of the event for their great job: the selection of the speeches were super interesting and inspiring, in addition to the sublime organization of the whole event. It was an honor and a great experience to attend the conference for the first time.


## Google as a Machine Learning first company

From how the event went and the selection of the speeches, I have the impression that Google changed and took a big step to become a Machine Learning first company.

Google introduced in the conferences their [Machine Learning API](https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/), they performed some demos and showed how fast and accurate their API is able to extract meta information from images or simply translate speech to text.

I remember back in the 2007, at my first company we built some tools using the Loquendo SDK (now adquired by [Nuance](http://www.nuance.com/for-business/automatic-speech-recognition/index.htm)) for automatic speech recognition system, and how hard and not precisse at that time was the speech recognition. Now you can believe how amazed I feel today after knowing the results of their Speech API that Google promises to the audience at the DevFestDC.

In addition, I can't imagine how excited (or angry) must be now some PhDs working on pattern recognition and image processing with the results of the Google Cloud Vision API. From an image, the API allows you to extract lots of information like location, facial recognition, descriptive related tags, among other data.

Kind of make sense for me now, back to 2001, when the Microsoft researchers Banko and Brill affirmed in a paper that the more data your model has, the more increase the accuracy of the model. And if there is anyone able to have access to a huge amount of data and used it efficently, that is the people from Google.

I believe that the accuracy and the good performance of the Google Machine Learning API is in a big part due to the power of data. As Google's Research Director Peter Norvig claimed once, "We donâ€™t have better algorithms. We just have more data.".

So guys, now you can expect the use of Machine Learning functionalities in almost every tool provided by Google. Let's say, for instance, in your Google Photos account, you will be able to display only the pictures taken in a city by just seaching the work 'city', and without the need to add metadata to your files.


### TensorFlow

To conclude, the last month I have been focused on finishing the [Andrew Ng's Coursera class on Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), and although it is very well explained for students without a high level of Statistics, Math and Computer Science; it is not an easy task and requires some effort and commitment to be able to follow the class and finish it.

I guess now it is time for me to play around with Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and check out if it delivers what the people from Google promises: a door for the not high-skilled developers on easily and straightforward train computers to perform Machine Learning tasks.
