It is widely adopted, so lots of IoT solutions use it as the protocol to interconnect devices.</p><p>These series of posts will try to go through the process of creating a MQTT broker from scratch, I will try to explain the problems, solutions and considerations I met during the process.</p><h2 id="topics">Topics</h2><p>Let’s go straight to the point, the MQTT broker is the main character of the publish/subscribe protocol. It is the responsible to keep the track of the devices that are subscribed to a topic: it filters and recieves messages from devices, and then it decides after which other devices need to be notified.</p><p>To make this possible, the MQTT broker filter the message by means of the topic, a string that contains one or more topic levels. The following example will clarify what it is exactly a topic:</p><p>’’’ /house/kitchen/fridge/temperature ‘’’</p><p>The string use slashes to separete each level of the topic, they are case-sensitive and each level must contain at least one character.</p><p>Devices can publish and susbcribe to any level of the topic, although it is recommended to use specific topics instead of general ones.</p><h2 id="trie-structure">Trie structure</h2></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
