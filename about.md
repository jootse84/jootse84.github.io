Hi, I’m Jose. A passionate software engineer, data enthusiastic and an obsessed traveller. I like solving problems, that's why I enjoy my profession and the prep up for any upcoming situations while wildly travelling.

I’ve worked at start-ups in Barcelona, [Hong Kong](https://www.hkstp.org/en/index.aspx) and Taipei. My most recent projects include developing a mobile payment system, designing and scaling an IoT platform service, and creating the UI for multiple control panels for data visualization. 

Currently I split my time between Barcelona and Washington, DC. 

Check back here for notes on my latest projects.
