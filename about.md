Hi, I’m Jose. I'm a passionate software engineer, data enthusiast and an [obsessed traveller](https://www.flickr.com/photos/121894947@N08/albums/72157678644655521). I like solving problems, that’s why I enjoy my work and all the prep and thinking-on-your-feet associated with travelling.

I’ve worked at start-ups in Barcelona, [Hong Kong](https://www.hkstp.org/en/index.aspx), Taipei and I am on my way to start a programmer's sabbatical at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in New York. My most recent projects include developing a mobile payment system, designing and scaling an IoT platform service, and creating the UI for multiple control panels for data visualization.

Currently I split my time between Barcelona and Washington, DC.

Check back here for notes on my latest projects and ideas.
