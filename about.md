Hi, I’m Jose. I’m a software engineer who likes writing clean and schematic code. 

I’ve worked at start-ups in Barcelona, Hong Kong and Taipei. My most recent projects include developing a mobile payment system, designing and scaling an IoT platform service, and creating the UI for multiple control panels for data visualization. 

Currently I split my time between Barcelona and Washington, DC. 

Check back here for notes on my latest projects.
