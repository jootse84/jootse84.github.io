The bigger the problem, the better. Whether it's diving into a disaster of bugs for an application or teaching myself about machine learning on the fly and coming up with a map visualization of IoT devices, I'm happiest when I'm facing a completely new challenge and have to adapt fast, try lots of ideas and figure out a different way of doing things.

I love that feeling of starting with nothing and having to build from the ground up, from researching new libraries and frameworks to developing relationships with new teammates, and learning how to solve problems together. Some of my best friends to this day are people I've worked with.

With more than six years of experience working in Barcelona, Hong Kong and Taiwan as software engineer in many different settings--big companies, small start-ups with international teams, now I realized about the importance of writting down the tasks I consider important or relevant on my daily work.

So here I am, starting another developer blog from the thousands that already exist. On this occasion, this blog is only for my joy.
