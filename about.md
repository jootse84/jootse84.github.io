The bigger the problem, the better. Whether it's diving into a disaster of bugs for a new mobile payment platform or teaching myself about machine learning on the fly and coming up with a map visualization of IoT devices, I'm happiest when I'm facing a completely new challenge and have to adapt fast, try lots of ideas and figure out a different way of doing things.

I love to challenge myself and love to learn new things. Currently I'm teaching myself machine learning and Spark.

I love that feeling of starting with nothing and having to build from the ground up, from researching new libraries and frameworks to developing relationships with new teammates, and learning how to solve problems together. Some of my best friends to this day are people I've worked with.

With more than six years of experience working as software engineer in many different settings--big companies, small start-ups with international teams, I have a proven track record of doing X and have accomplished Y and Z.

I have lived and worked in Barcelona, Hong Kong, Taiwan and now I'm looking to join a team of people in the US who love to work together, try new things and build awesome projects.
